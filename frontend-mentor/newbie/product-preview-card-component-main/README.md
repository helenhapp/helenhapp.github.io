## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use `<picture></picture>` element to show different images for different screen sizes. I also learned how to use Grid to style the content with two columns. And I used `clamp()` to set dynamic font sizes for some elements.

### Continued development

I want to learn more about the media queries - when it's best to use them, and when there might be a better and simpler alternative.

### Useful resources

- [The picture element (web.dev)](https://web.dev/learn/design/picture-element) - This helped me understand how the picture element works. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
