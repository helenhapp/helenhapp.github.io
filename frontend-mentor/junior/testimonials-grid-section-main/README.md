## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I became more familiar with using CSS Grid and tried my best to make the webpage look good on different devices. I also learned how to set a background-image.

### Continued development

CSS Grid is a powerful tool and I wish to continue exploring it until I become well familiar with all its abilities and understand when to use them.

### Useful resources
